<h3>HTML/CSS/JavaScript</h3>
<p>
The prototype is built using HTML and CSS with JavaScript for any features, such as the notification or error boxes on the Add Event page. A separate HTML file is used for each screen, with buttons acting as links to other pages.
<br>
The prototype closely follows the chosen design, using the displayed appearance and features.
</p>

<h3>Page Descriptions</h3>
<p>
  The login page requires the user to enter their user ID and password. After signing in, the main page will load. In the main page, the user can view the activities scheduled for the current month. The user can switch to view by week option.  The user can add events by clicking on the add event option on the top right corner. The user can generate an activity summary graph by clicking on generated graphs located at the bottom of the page. The software also allows users to customize their page under the settings option located on the right top corner of the page.
</p>
<p>
	The Add Event page gives the user options for creating a new event for the calendar. There are two text boxes, one for the name of the event and an option box for notes about the event. Two checkboxes are used to toggle if the event should be scheduled for all future weeks and if there should be a notification prior to the event. The date, start and end time are chosen using dropdown selection as well as the type of event and time before the notification.
<br>
  In this prototype, a notification box will appear immediately if the “Notify me” box is checked and an error message will appear if the start time is later than the end time. For the final product the notification will appear at the chosen time and the error message will appear based on both the chosen time as well as using conflicts with existing schedules.
</p>
<p>
	The user can switch from month view to week view by clicking on the view by week option. By clicking on the week of interest, the scheduled activity content would be displayed on the page. The user can switch back to monthly view by clicking on the view by month option located on the bottom of the page.
	In the settings page, the user can customize the fonts and interface colours of the app from a variety of choices. The users can also choose to temporarily turn off the notification function by clicking on the classmode checkbox.
